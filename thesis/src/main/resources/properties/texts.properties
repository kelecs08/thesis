introduction=This game is a custom implementation of the game called Blob wars.
creator=The creator: Kelecsényi Anna\nThe project administrator: Nagy Sára
aim=Aim:\nGain control of the board by attacking the opponents blobs and converting them to your own!
step=How to step:\nYou can step if you are the actual player - the labels which show your name and the number of fields taken by you have black backgrounds. Select a blob on your team by clicking on it with the mouse. Once selected, the blob's background will turn black and the possible moves you may take will be shown with gray color. Click on a highlighted space to complete your move.\nIf you click on the blob, you have selected previously, the selection will be terminated and you can choose another blob on your team.
step-two=There are two ways you can step:\n1. You can multiply your blobs by choosing a field that is a direct neighbour of your clicked figure.\n2. Or you can transport your blob to a field that is two steps away from your position, not changing the number of blobs you own.
fight=If you step to a position which direct neighbours are the enemy's puppets, you will overtake them. So your fields will increase.
win=To win the game, you have to own the most fields on the board or corner your enemy, so they cannot move anymore with either of their blobs.\nThe game can end in a draw too as there are even fields on the board.
good-luck=Good luck with the game, hope you enjoy it - and win! :D
